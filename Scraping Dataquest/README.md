# Scraping Dataquest for Course List

My goal with this personal project is to get the list of courses of the Data Scientist track on Dataquest in order to track my progress.

The result of web scraping is a CSV file including all missions, links to the description of each mission and the name of the course each mission belongs to.

## Contents:
* **Scraping_Dataquest.ipynb**: web scraping using Python's BeautifulSoup library
* **dataquest_courses.csv**: the CSV file obtained by web scraping
